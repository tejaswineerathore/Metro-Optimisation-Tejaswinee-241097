As in the previous class you saw about data visualisation.Now your next task is to make a doc file for this to do actual research on optimisation of Delhi Metro.Read Resarch Papers,look into the organisation of metro in other cities of differnt countries.Then try to make a optimised plan for our beloved India's largest metro network.Craft your own ideas as they will be further worked upon using code.Our target is to make Delhi Metro optimised using your research.We wiill probably using Machine Learning Models to recognise some patterns but building upon that is your responsibility.
Hence Ensure you deliver quality content!!



In case you were not part of the previous session,kindly make it to your knowledge by asking the attendees so that you can serve better.Also in the next session we will be discussing the solution,so you all will be required to present your solution in the next meet.Also,if by chance you have not submitted any previous assignemnt ,it is still your chance to make it.Another else,no other opportunities will be provided.

Hoping to get good responses,otherwise this is your last time !!
