Week2:

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), primary processing, and data visualization : EDA:

How does the data look?
Are there any duplicate entries? If yes, then what to do?
Are there any missing entries? If yes, then what to do?
Is the data inconsistent somewhere?
Have a look at these resources:

Data Pre-Processing: Getting your data ready to be fed into your classification algorithms. Which involves cleaning your data for any noise or unnecessary elements. For text dataset, that would mean:

Removing Stopwords
Removing special characters like emojis, hashtags, etc
Convert all the text into Lowercase for generalisation.
Removing punctuations and any other thing you may think does not affect the text's sentiment
I am uploading my python notebook which I have made by basing on the Big Molecule Smiles dataset based on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yanmaksi/big-molecules-smiles-dataset.

Your assignment for the first week is to take any dataset on kaggle, and submit a python notebook showing how you have answered the above four questions and completed preprocessing on the dataset. I would advise you to run the dataset by me before you use it so that you don't end up wasting your time.

The deadline to submit is Saturday EOD.

Feel free to ping me incase of any doubts.

PS: my file also contains feature extraction which I will cover in the next lecture. for now, just do the pre-processing part.
